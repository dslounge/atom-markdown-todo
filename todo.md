# Markdown Atom todo TODO

This is an example of one of my TODO documents. Each week I decide what to do
and when. These items are separated by category, and inside each category
there's a list of things to do, with a day they're supposed to be done, and
whether they are done or not.

Some goals:
- I would like this to automatically highlight the things I need to do TODAY
- I would like this to mute things that have already been done.
- I would like this to automatically show me a percentage of things that are done.
- I would like to be able to specify badges (all caps text), and colors for those badges.
  - The DONE text would be a badge, for example.
